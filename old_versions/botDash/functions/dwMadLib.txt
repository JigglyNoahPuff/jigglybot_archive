"_EXCLAMATION_!" I shout as the last of the regeneration energy fades. Every _noun_ of my _part of the body_ has been rewritten, and the _noun_ that I once was is no more. But I am alive, very much so. _verb ending in "ing"_ to my feet, it finally strikes me... what do I look like?  Am I _adjective_, or do I have _number_ heads? Oh, what about a/an _noun_? I've never been one of those before. I begin to take inventory of my new _noun_, starting by _verb ending in "ing"_ my _part of the body_.  That's odd... it feels _adjective_ and a little bit like a/an _animal_. And my _part of body (plural)_, they feel like they are the size _plural noun_. Everything is new, and yet I'm the same _noun_ I've always been. One thing is certain...I am still the _noun_! Oh, and my hair, please tell me it's _color_.
